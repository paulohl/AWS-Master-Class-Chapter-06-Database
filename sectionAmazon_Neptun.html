excels at storing and querying data with intricate relationships. It
serves as a powerful tool for applications that rely on highly connected
data, such as social networks, recommendation engines, and knowledge
graphs.
In this section, we will explore <i>Amazon Neptune</i> , its features,
compatibility with different graph models, scalability, and use cases.
This will help you understand how this managed graph database service a
valuable addition to your application architecture can be, especially
for scenarios involving highly connected data and complex relationships.</div><h2 data-label="key-features-and-advantages-6" class="ltx_title_subsection">Key features and
advantages</h2><div>The following are features and advantages of <i>Amazon Neptune:</i></div><ul><li><b>Graph database model:</b> <i>Amazon Neptune</i> is purpose-built
for graph data. It supports both property graph and (Resource
Description Framework) <i>RDF</i> graph models, making it flexible for
various use cases. Property graph models [56] are often used for
highly connected data with complex relationships, while RDF graph
models are suitable for representing and querying semantic data
[57].</li><li><b>Universally available and scalable:</b> Neptune provides high
availability through multiple AZs, ensuring redundancy and automatic
failover. It can also scale out [58] to accommodate growing
workloads [59].</li><li><b>Support for multiple Query languages:</b> Neptune supports
popular graph query languages like <i>SPARQL</i> [60] and<i>Apache</i> [61] <i>TinkerPop Gremlin</i> , allowing you to
choose the query language that best suits your application [62].</li><li><b>Security:</b> The service offers data encryption at rest and in
transit. It integrates with AWS <i>IAM</i> for access control and<i>Amazon VPC</i> for network isolation [63].</li></ul><h2 data-label="use-cases-6" class="ltx_title_subsection">Use cases</h2><div><i>Amazon Neptune</i> supports applications that require advanced
relationship modeling and querying, making it ideal for use cases such
as social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines, knowledge
graphs, and life sciences research [64].</div>
