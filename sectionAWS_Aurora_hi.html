<h1 data-label="aws-aurora-high-performance-relational-database" class="ltx_title_section">AWS Aurora high-performance relational
database</h1><div><i>Amazon Aurora</i> [2], a product of AWS, has rapidly gained
recognition and popularity for its exceptional capabilities as a
high-performance, fully managed relational database engine. As a dynamic
cloud-based service, it addresses the demands of businesses and
enterprises by delivering the robustness and capabilities of
commercial-grade databases while eliminating the intricacies, overheads,
and inflated costs often associated with them.
This section thoroughly explores Amazon Aurora, emphasizing its key
features and integrating insights from scholarly articles and AWS
documentation. References appear throughout the text where relevant. You
can include more scholarly sources in later sections covering other AWS
database services.</div><h2 data-label="key-features-of-amazon-aurora" class="ltx_title_subsection">Key features of Amazon
Aurora</h2><div><i>Amazon Aurora</i> brings to the table a range of outstanding
features, making it an ideal choice for AWS users who require a powerful
relational database:</div><ul><li><b>Compatibility</b> : Amazon Aurora is compatible with <i>MySQL</i> and <i>PostgreSQL,</i> ensuring a seamless migration process for
existing databases. Its <i>drop-in replacement</i> nature means that
transitioning to Aurora is hassle-free, requiring minimal adjustments
to your applications.</li><li><b>High performance</b> : Aurora achieves exceptional performance,
delivering up to five times the throughput of standard MySQL databases
and up to twice the throughput of standard PostgreSQL databases, all
on the same hardware. This prominent level of performance makes Aurora
an ideal choice for applications that require extensive transaction
processing and data handling.</li><li><b>High availability</b> : Designed with high availability in mind,
Amazon Aurora replicates data across six instances in three
availability zones. This strategy not only enhances reliability but
also ensures seamless failover support, effectively minimizing
downtime.</li><li><b>Fault-tolerant storage</b> : The storage layer of Amazon Aurora is
notable for its fault tolerance. It continuously backs up your data to
Amazon S3 while also ensuring transparent recovery from any physical
storage failures. This provides the peace of mind that your data is
well protected and recoverable.</li><li><b>Global databases</b> : For applications that cater to a global
user base, <i>Amazon Aurora’s Global Databases</i> [13] feature is
invaluable. It replicates data across multiple AWS regions, enabling
low-latency global reads.</li></ul><h2 data-label="performance-benchmarking" class="ltx_title_subsection">Performance benchmarking</h2><div>Scholarly articles and independent studies consistently demonstrate<i>Amazon Aurora’s</i> superior performance when compared to other
databases. Research by <i>Faleiro, Van Renesse</i> , and <i>Rodrigues</i> (2016) [14] found that Aurora outperformed <i>MySQL</i> and handled
high-throughput workloads with significantly lower latencies, confirming
its position as a high-performance database solution.
AWS also highlights Aurora’s ability to scale read operations linearly,
supporting up to 15 read replicas for both MySQL and PostgreSQL
compatibility [15]; [16] This scalability is crucial for
applications that require efficient and dynamic handling of read
operations.</div><h2 data-label="case-studies" class="ltx_title_subsection">Case studies</h2><div>A collection of case studies within AWS customer success stories
[17] provides concrete examples of how organizations have harnessed
the power of <i>Amazon Aurora</i> . These case studies underscore the
high availability and scalability Aurora offers, bringing real-world
applications into sharper focus.<i>Amazon Aurora</i> is a compelling choice for organizations in search
of a cost-effective solution that encompasses the performance and
reliability characteristic of commercial-grade databases. It boasts
compatibility with <i>MySQL</i> and <i>PostgreSQL</i> , exceptional
performance, high availability, fault-tolerant storage, and global
database capabilities. In the following sections of this chapter, we
will delve into a multitude of other AWS database services, each
tailored to distinct use cases.
